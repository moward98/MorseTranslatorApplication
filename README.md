# Morse Code Translator App

A morse code translator created in C#, with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created using XAML.

## Introduction

Hello there! I created this app to allow a user to see what their (possibly secret) message would be when converted into Morse Code. Or, if you already know Morse Code, you can 'transmit' your message and have it displayed in text.

## Languages

All of the inner workings of this application are written in C#, and the GUI is written in XAML.
